# Hello-World
OK, I got it.  However the Learn Git is wrong in a very subtle way.
The very first issue is the way the original branch is named.  In the tutorial is called Main but in reality it is master.
And if this was not discouraging enough, the language "branch: main" does not exist at all.  There is no "branch:" and there is no "main".  So if you are totaly new to change management and control but, an excellent hawk analyst (like me) you would get discoraged
right away.
SO, do as I did, IGNORE the language and press on.  Hopefully this is the only flaw I find.  This is at step 2
